# Lections for Scripting programming languages subject (JavaScript) 
But for now, most of materials are little bit old, (for example for REACT JS)
Other parts will still work.


### jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are used for interactive scripts execution, but pay attention, that 
JS is not a standard type of jupyter notebook, so node-js extension for jupyter should be installed 
for running this notebooks

*Feel free to use idea of **interactive lections** with jupyter notebooks, extensions can help to implement such idea for 
different programming languages*
